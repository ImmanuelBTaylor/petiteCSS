# petiteCSS: A Sass-based Utility Framework 

petiteCSS aims to be a full Tailwind CSS equivalent but implemented using Sass. It allows for extensive customization and extendibility through Sass's features. 

- Customization: You can configure various aspects of the framework using a Sass map, including colors, utility variants, and responsiveness.
- Extendibility: It leverages the power of Sass to generate utility classes, allowing for a highly customizable and maintainable system, which aligns with the modular approach of Sass partials.
